            <h2 class="about-me-title">About Me</h2>
            <p>Studied Computer Science at Tamkang University and Yuan Ze University for two years before obtaining a Bachelor's in Philosophy from Fu Jen Catholic University. Familiar with computer science fundamentals, including data structures, algorithms, and various programming languages. After graduation, I developed an interest in web development and began to research and cultivate familiarity with related technologies in the field.</p>
            <p>My main interest in software engineering arises from a sense of achievement. Programming is related to almost everything in the modern world, whether it be an app, a website, or a game. And the fact that I can do it with my own hands always cheers me up. I hope someday I can benefit this world with the products I make and that I continue learning and progressing towards achieving my goals and pursuing ever greater standards of excellence.
